This repo implements as sample E-Commerce platform to demonstrate different PWA features, like making a web app installable, caching strategies for offline functionality, background sync and push notifications.

Currently, the code only makes the web app installable as a PWA with deferred prompt for app install banner, when an item is added to the shopping cart. Rest of the features will be added incrementally, as this repo is part of a PWA series on YouTube.

Here is the link to the first video on YouTube, discussing the installation criteria and also testing it in mobile environments (Android emulator and a real Android device):
