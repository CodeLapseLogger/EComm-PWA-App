This repo implements a sample E-Commerce platform to demonstrate different PWA features, like making a web app installable, caching strategies for offline functionality, background sync and push notifications.

Currently, the code makes:
1) The web app installable as a PWA with deferred prompt for app install banner, when an item is added to the shopping cart.
2) Leverages caching for offline availability through CACHE API: 
   (i) Static Caching
   (ii) Dynamic Caching
   (iii) Cache Versioning

Rest of the features will be added incrementally, as this repo is part of a PWA series on YouTube.

Here is the link to the first video on YouTube, discussing the installation criteria and also testing it in mobile environments (Android emulator and a real Android device):
